# ?

Jiffy is a parser-combinator library written in Swift. It's heavily inspired by FParsec.

# And?

It's also a parser for the [Doge Serialized Object Notation](http://dogeon.org/) protocol.

# Parser combinators?

Are fantastic, and you can read all about them here: ["Dive into parser combinators"](http://blog.fogcreek.com/fparsec/).

Its strong, pro-generics type system means we can write something like parser combinators in it.
