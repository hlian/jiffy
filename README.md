# ?

Jiffy is a parser-combinator library written in Swift. Its combinators are heavily inspired by FParsec; its types, by Haskell Applicative monad.

# And?

Included is a work-in-progress parser for the [Doge Serialized Object Notation](http://dogeon.org/), the premier textual data representation of our time.

# Parser combinators?

Are fantastic, and you can read all about them here: ["Dive into parser combinators"](http://blog.fogcreek.com/fparsec/). Whoever wrote that must be a pretty OK dude.

# Swift?

[Swift](http://haskell.org/) is a new language with a compiler that crashes and hangs a lot.
Generics and typeclasses I mean protocols are ideal for something like parser combinators, don't you think? Having custom operators doesn't hurt either.
