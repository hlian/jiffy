# ?

Jiffy is a parser-combinator library written in Swift. Its combinators are heavily inspired by FParsec; its types, by Haskell's Applicative monad.

# And?

Included is a work-in-progress parser for the [Doge Serialized Object Notation](http://dogeon.org/), the premier textual data representation of our times.

# Parser combinators?

Are fantastic, and you can read all about them here: ["Dive into parser combinators"](http://blog.fogcreek.com/fparsec/).

# Swift?

[Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) is a new language with a compiler that crashes and hangs a lot.
Its strong, pro-generics type system means we can write something like parser combinators in it. Having custom operators doesn't hurt either.
